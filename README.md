(Sorry for the destracting selfmade wallpaper)


This includes:
 - tiling-windowmanager (i3-gaps)
 - statusbar (polybar and i3blocks)
 - low battery / efficiency mode
 - compositor (compton)
 - start menu (rofi)

optional:
 - Spotify (https://spotify.com)
 - Atom editor (https://atom.io)
 - office suite (libreoffice)
 - image editor (gimp)

The goal is to have everything set up and installed using a single script (at the moment called 'run').

# Warning
This project is nowhere near finished. Keep in mind that this is only supposed to work on a fresh install of Ubuntu.
Install Ubuntu from the Network installer ISO available from https://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads.
Choose "command-line install" in the boot menu.
This project is currently tested on Ubuntu 17.10, however every still supported Ubuntu version should work in theory.

Feel free to ask for help!
I would be very happy to have any kind of contribution or advise!
