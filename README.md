# Tilede
A set of applications aiming to provide a stable desktop environment built on the base of i3 (-gaps).
The goal is to provide a fast and battery efficient system for everyday use, especially for programming.

This includes:
 - tiling-windowmanager (i3-gaps)
 - statusbar (polybar and i3blocks)
 - compositor (compton)
 - run menu (rofi)

optional:
 - Spotify
 - Atom editor
 - office suite (libreoffice)
 - image editor (gimp)

The goal is to have everything set up and installed using a single script (at the moment called 'run').

# Warning
This project is nowhere near finished. Keep in mind that this is only supposed to work on a fresh install of Ubuntu.
Install Ubuntu from the Network installer ISO available from https://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads.
Choose "command line install" in the boot menu.
This project is currently tested on Ubuntu 17.10, however every still supported Ubuntu version should work in theory.

Feel free to ask for help!
I would be very happy to have any kind of contribution or advise!

# Future goals

 - advanced install script providing package selection 
 - package manager for automatic configuration (maybe not needed)
